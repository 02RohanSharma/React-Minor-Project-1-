# React Minor Project 1

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is built using React and Vite, and serves as a minor project to demonstrate a modern front-end application architecture.  
The goal is to showcase usage of React components, state & props management, modern tooling (Vite), ESLint for code quality, and a well-structured folder layout.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project  
- To build a clean, maintainable UI application using React + Vite.  
- To apply best-practices in modern front-end development: fast bundling (via Vite), hot-module replacement, linting, and clear project structure.  
- To serve as a base/template for further front-end expansions or as a learning project for React beginners.  
- To demonstrate ability to set up a project from scratch (rather than using create-react-app boilerplate) and integrate the necessary tooling.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used  
- **React** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used here for creating component-based UI.  
- **Vite** – A build tool that provides ultra-fast development server and optimized build step.  
- **ESLint** – For static code analysis and enforcing code style/quality.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern JavaScript syntax is used throughout the codebase.  
- **HTML & CSS** – Basic markup and styling for the UI (you can extend to SCSS/Styled-Components etc.).  
- **Node.js and npm / yarn** – For managing dependencies, scripts, and the build process.
